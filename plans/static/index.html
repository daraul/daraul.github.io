<p>Your website will be built using the static site generator <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" title="It's great, don't worry!">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://getforge.com/" target="_blank">Forge</a>.</p>

<h2>Why would you want this?</h2>
<p>Your best example of what you can get here is this website! Let's say you're a small startup and you just need to tell people what you do, list some prices and maybe give them a way to get in touch and start working on something together: You don't need to go to Godaddy, install an entire CMS, setup a database and <i>then</i> start doing some work. That's overkill and you're ultimately paying for a lot of technology you don't need. With a jekyll built site you create your content, have jekyll build it and you're left with a completely static site that you can host pretty much anywhere. The reason I use Forge for hosting static sites is their blazing fast CDN and incredibly useful deployment options.</p>
